# My First Data Science Project!
This time I was trying to predict energy usage by using a machine learning model, Ridge Regression. 

The model that I'm developing will try to answer this question: 
1. What feature that is strongly effect the rise of energy usage? 
2. What time of day that most of energy used?
3. Does ridge regression is the right ML model to predict energy usage?

I'm taking the dataset from kaggle:
